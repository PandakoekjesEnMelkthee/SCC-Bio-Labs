			<h1>Writing a Flawed Compte Rendu About a Regrettable Practical</h1>

                    <h4 style="margin-top:2%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">Students of the Institute of Life Science and Technology are experiencing a retrogression in education due to the lack of expertise within the institute which has resulted in the loss of ingenuity as a whole. Milan from Research reports.<br><br>
                        Maarten Mols, supervisor of Research and headmaster of SquidwardCC Bio Labs, recently announced the announcement that due to inclusivity reasons (woke) parents will not be permitted on the premises, which has been announced. Due to inclusivity, this article will be written in English. Moving on, due to inclusivity all the clowns of Research will be gifted a paper. According to Maarten Mols, availability of the parents will lead to mass starvation, terrorism, war crimes, air pollution and bad coffee (geen DE, alleen een skere bakkie!). Due to inclusivity, we love Jesus.
                        <br><br>Being serious, the past few weeks during the semester have been heavy. During the little time since the start of the new academic year, the workload is the equivalent of a university bachelor's. First of all, the first exam was on biochemistry, the book that was used consisted of 900 pages. Besides, the authors had the audacity to call it a 'short' course. Furthermore, because the curriculum is executed in weeks of three the module had been extended to 6 weeks to conform to the ammount of material that was to be taught.  </h4>
                    <h4 style="margin-top:2%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">Besides the amount of information that had to be taught, practicals were of course also a part of the module. In this case it included a multi day experiment measuring the activity of laccase in certain fungi and finally writing a scientific article about it. Additionaly, statistic analyses were to be performed. As the title might suggest, the practicals this module were made up of a series of dissapointing lab days. For instance, I recall being at the lab from 8:30am till 6pm as performing a statisical analysis was required before we left. Understandably, many of us were tired and desired to go home, as were the teachers. Moreover, the data we had to work with was incredibly confusing. In certain parts of our experiment we did not use our own fungi for example and had to use from other groups. This made it difficult to keep track of progress. 
                        <br><br> As it is important to not only stand still at the practical, the propeadeutic ceremony will also be discussed. As mentioned earlier, parents were not allowed on the premises as the budget of the institute could not cover their prescence due to a lack of funding. The ceremony itself was quite uninteresting and uneventful, as humiliating the students of the mentors stood central here. Besides, many of the students who were eligible to receive their diploma did not actually show up, since the event was held late in the day and a long was behind us. UNDERSTANDABLE of course! 
                        <br><br> All in all, we should all die for the glory of squidward community college and make sure things like this will never happen again. Thanks to my pookies who helped me write this!
